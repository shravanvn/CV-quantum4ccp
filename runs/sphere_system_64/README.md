# 64-Spheres Example

- Run the `generate_init.py` script to generate an `init.txt` file describing a
  regular lattice-like arrangement of the spheres with random initial velocity.

- Each run of the above script will generate different initial velocities.

- The `init_ref.txt` is an example instantiation, committed for future
  reference.
